# Doug's Portfolio Site

My site to show off some basic front-end things.

## Future Plans

I'm working on a Go service that will geolocate visitors' IP addresses and show them on the map in real-time through websockets. We'll see when that happens as there will probably only be like 1-2 people viewing the site at any given time, so not a huge priority.
